""" what I answered for twitter AP"""I
Hi
I am a hobbyist who is exploring the field of web development. I do not intend to use the API to display twitter tweets on any of my blog and I do not plan to analyze any Twitter data and neither do I intend to tweet, Retweet, like, follow, or Direct Message functionality. I just need the API for authentication so as to proceed in my learning and coding hobby
